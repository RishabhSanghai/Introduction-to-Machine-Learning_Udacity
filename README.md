Welcome! 🎉  
This repository contains my work and experiments for **Udacity’s Introduction to Machine Learning (ud120)** course.  
It includes starter code, mini-projects, and notes — restructured and cleaned up for clarity and ease of use.

## 📚 About the Course

[Udacity’s Introduction to Machine Learning (ud120)](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) is one of the foundational machine learning courses.  
It covers the essentials of:

- 📝 **Preprocessing** – cleaning and preparing data  
- 🌲 **Decision Trees** – basic classification  
- 📬 **Naive Bayes** – probabilistic learning  
- 🏷 **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** – separating classes with hyperplanes  
- 🔍 **Clustering (k-means)** – unsupervised learning  
- ✂️ **Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction** – PCA, LDA  
- 📈 **Model Evaluation** – accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  

By the end, you’ll have built your own machine learning pipeline and applied it to a real-world dataset.
